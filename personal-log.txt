felt good about the work done today. Felt good to solve problems in a natural feeling way instead of feeling rushed.

Some things to work on tomorrow:

User's
    -Views
        +Show and format correct data on User Show View
        +create MyProfile Controller to seperate duties. Want to see if it makes an easier experience. Also just makes sense if
        i want the My Profile to be more robust and scalable. also keeps the user controller clean and concise and has one job
        


Some misc notes:

Ideas
    +Make it so Post-Event photos can be uploaded to the event page, but only for 48 hours after the event has started. Then the 
    event locks and creates a time capsule type object.
        -User's Could still rate or comment on the event, as long as the were an attendee for the event
            ?How could the user or I confirm attendence of the event if we only wanted TRUE attendees to be able to have interaction
            permissions
